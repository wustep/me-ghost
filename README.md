## Development

Use `gulp` to run compile task with Sass, Autoprefixer, and JSHint, watching for changes.

Use `gulp deploy` to recompile stylesheets, create zip file of theme, and gscan to validate.

## Installation

TBD with route setup / .yml stuff

1. [Install Ghost](https://docs.ghost.org/setup/), see note below about modifying.
2. Under **Design**: add `Projects` to `/tag/projects/` and `Articles` to `/tag/articles`

   If desired, add `LinkedIn` to LinkedIn url, and `GitHub` to GitHub url.

3. Create a page with URL `/home`. This will be shown on the home page.
4. Write posts that are tagged `projects` and `articles`! (Not both.)

### Modifications to Ghost

Some minor mods were made to Ghost, particularly:

#### \#has tag for labels

In `has.js`, add `label` to `validAttrs` and add to `checks` object (line 140ish):

```
label: function() {
  return (
    (attrs.label && evaluateTagList(attrs.label, [self.label], true)) ||
    false
  );
},
```

#### Routes

Replace your `routes.yaml` with the one in this directory.
