# Me

ðŸ‘» This is my personal [Ghost](https://ghost.org) theme used on [wustep.me](https://wustep.me).

## Features

#### Features planned

- Front page with post content, 3 recent projects, and 3 articles
  - Post content should be in a single post tagged `#home` and be `featured`
  - Projects should be tagged `projects` and be `featured`
  - Articles should be tagged `articles` and be `featured`
  - The 3 most recent (by creation date) articles & projects will be shown
  - These are configurable in package.json
- Dedicated Projects tab
  - These should be tagged `projects`
  - Set `/projects` to route to `/tags/projects`
  - Projects will be loaded by creation date, with `featured` projects first
  - [Idea] Custom JS-based emoji table of contents at the top. Each emoji links to a project and displays its title.
- Dedicated Articles tab
  - These should be tagged `articles`
  - Set `/articles` to route to `/tags/articles`
  - Articles will be loaded by creation date, with `featured` projects first
  - Use `#short` tag to remove link to dedicated page
- Dedicated tags category pages (same template as Projects / Articles)
- LinkedIn and GitHub links
