**De-prioritized:**

  - Set up form action and errors
- Multi-author byline support
- Proper RSS feeds
- Fork into generic Bulma + Ghost theme

## Development

- With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed, install `gulp` globally with `npm install -g gulp`.

- `gulp`: compiles with Sass, Autoprefixer, Sass-lint, JSHint, Minify, watching for changes.

  - Ghost reloads `.hbs` changes by default, but new partials will require a `ghost restart`.

- `gulp deploy`: recompile everything, create `.zip` for production and uses `gscan` to validate.

- To run Ghost: `ghost start`, `ghost restart`, or `ghost run [session-name] --development` for logs

## Setup

0. [Install Ghost](https://docs.ghost.org/setup/) and complete modifications noted below.

1. Clone this repo to `/content/themes`, then (`npm install`) and (use `gulp`) or (`gulp deploy` and upload zip file to **Settings -> Design**).

1. Under **Settings -> Navigation**: add:

```javascript
Home -> /
Articles -> /articles/
Projects -> /projects/
Notes -> /notes/
(optional)
LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Facebook
```

3. Create a **page** with URL `/home`. This will be shown on the home page.

4. Write **posts** that are tagged `Projects`, `Articles`, or `Notes`!

5. Set up [Commento](https://commento.io/) account for comments.

### Modifications to Ghost

Some minor mods were made to the Ghost code, particularly:

#### 1. \#has tag for labels

This is used for the navigation bar, to have `Home`, `Projects`, and `Articles` be on the left-aligned and any other link to be right-aligned.

- In ghost folder: `core/server/helpers/has.js`, add `label` to `validAttrs` and add to `checks` object (line 140ish):

```javascript
label: function() {
  return (
    (attrs.label && evaluateTagList(attrs.label, [self.label], true)) ||
    false
  );
},
```

#### 2. Routes

Routes were modified to change `tag/projects` -> `projects`, `tag/articles` -> `articles`, and `tag/notes` -> `notes` and have the user-created page `/home` -> `/`.

- Replace your `content/settings/routes.yaml` with the `routes.yaml` in this repository, modifying as desired.

#### 3. Add `use-commento` and `use-applause` config properties.

We added two config properties to let users enable or disable [commento](https://commento.io/) / [applause](https://applause-button.com/). Edit `package.json` if you want these enabled or disabled.

- In ghost folder: `core/server/services/themes/config/index.js`.

Add `use-commento` and `use-applause` to `allowedKeys`.

- In ghost folder: `core/server/services/themes/middleware.js`

Add `use-commento` and `use-applause` to `updateGlobalTemplateOptions` in same format:

```javascript
const themeData = {
  posts_per_page: activeTheme.get().config("posts_per_page"),
  image_sizes: activeTheme.get().config("image_sizes"),
  use_commento: activeTheme.get().config("use_commento"),
  use_applause: activeTheme.get().config("use_applause")
};
```

#### 4. (Optional) Change excerpt algorithm

TODO: Automatic excerpts, by default, tend to be a poor result and concatenate multiple lines together without proper spacing. Optionally, revise the `excerpt` code to catch only the first `<p>` block instead of carrying on.

### Other Optional Changes

#### Add more internal pages

By default, only "Home", "Projects", "Articles", and "Ideas" are in the left side of the nav. To add more internal pages to the nav bar, edit `partials/navigation.hbs` and make sure the new label is listed in the `#has` and `^has` statements.

#### Contact button

Use a service like Typeform to add a "Contact" button to the `home` page.

Edit the button to use Bulma, with class `button` and `is-success` (or [another color](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/colors/))!

Example:

```html
<a class="typeform-share button is-success" ...>Contact Me</a>
```

#### Subscribe button

(This isn't completed yet! In the meantime, you can use Typeform forms.)
Add a subscribe button somewhere with classes `subscribe-button button is-primary`:

```html
<a
  class="button subscribe-button is-primary"
  data-target="subscribe-modal"
  href="#subscribe"
  >Subscribe</a
>
```

#### Syntax highlighting changes

I added syntax highlighting through `highlight.js` for a limited number of languages that I felt I might use (including `[JavaScript, Python, Java, SQL, JSON, Markdown, HTTP, CSS, SCSS, ...]`).

I excluded many common ones, like `[C#, C++, Ruby, Makefiles, Apache]`, and there's tons more that can be added.

If you'd like to replace this library, [build your own package at highlightjs.org](https://highlightjs.org/download/) and replace `assets/lib/highlight.pack.js`.

To change the theme, follow the instructions in `assets/css/highlight.scss`.

#### Host Applause or Commento

You can choose to [host your own server of Applause](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/applause-button-server) and [Commento](https://docs.commento.io/getting-started/self-hosting/).

#### Hide Commento

To hide comments on any post, use `window.disableCommento` via Code Injection to `{{ghost_foot}}` in the Ghost panel:

```html
<script>
  window.disableCommento = true;
</script>
```
